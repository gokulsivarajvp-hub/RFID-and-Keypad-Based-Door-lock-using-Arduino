This project presents the design and implementation of a secure and user-friendly RFID and keypad-based door lock system using Arduino. The system integrates two authentication methods: RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and a numeric keypad, ensuring
enhanced security for residential, commercial, or office spaces. The primary goal of this project is to provide a convenient and reliable access control solution by
combining the robustness of RFID technology with the versatility of a keypad interface.
Keywords: Arduino Uno, Door lock, RFID, Keypad, integrating RFID and numeric keypad, dual-factor authentication.
