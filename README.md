Abstract - 

This project presents the design and implementation of a secure and user-friendly RFID and keypad-based door lock system using Arduino The system integrates two authentication methods: RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and a numeric keypad, ensuring enhanced security
for residential, commercial, or office spaces. The primary goal of this project is to provide a convenient and reliable access control solution by combining the robustness of RFID technology with the versatility of a keypad interface.

I. OBJECTIVE

To design and implement a secure door lock system using Arduino, integrating RFID and numeric keypad for dual-factor authentication.
Less complex architecture by simplifying the system design. The system aims to enhance access control by allowing entry only to authorized users through RFID tags or a PIN code, providing a reliable and user-friendly solution for securing residential, commercial,
or office spaces. By using dual-factor authentication (RFID and keypad), the system offers a higher level of security
compared to traditional key-based locks. Authorized individuals can unlock the door using an RFID tag/card or by entering a secure passcode, eliminating the need for physical keys. The system allows for easy addition or removal of RFID tags/cards and modification of the passcodes as needed, making it adaptable for different security needs.
The Arduino-based system can be integrated with other smart home components for automated control
(e.g., locking the door at certain times or when no one is home).
The system is cost-effective for residential or small office use and can be scaled up for more extensive
applications with multiple entry points.

II. INTRODUCTION

In today’s world, security is a primary concern for homes, offices, and other facilities. Traditional key-based locks are prone to theft, duplication, and unauthorized access, making them less reliable in the face of modern security challenges. To address these concerns, electronic access control systems have become increasingly popular, offering more secure and convenient solutions for entry
management.
One such system is the RFID and Keypad-based Door Lock using Arduino UNO, which combines two authentication methods—RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and a numeric keypad. RFID technology enables contactless identification of authorized users by reading unique RFID tags or cards, while the keypad allows for additional security through a personal identification number (PIN) entry. By integrating these two methods, the system enhances security by providing dual-factor authentication, requiring both an RFID tag and a correct PIN code for access. At the core of this system is the Arduino UNO, an open-source microcontroller that offers easy integration with a variety of sensors and modules. It serves as the control unit, processing inputs from the RFID reader and the keypad, and managing the operation of a locking mechanism, such as a servo motor or solenoid. The system ensures that only users with authorized credentials can unlock the door, thereby improving the safety of the premises. RFID is Radio Frequency Identification which is a fundamental and cheapest technology to enables wireless data transmission. Radio frequency Identification i.e., RFID is a non- contact technique applied in industries for personal tracking, supply chain management, management of books in libraries and at tollgate. RFID technology has a lack of standardization and hence it has not been very often among the manufacturing companies earlier. RFID technologies are more proficient and more secure as compare to other networks. RFID technology is used in many areas such as public transport, industrial automation, animal identification, ticketing, inventory detection, electronic immobilization, access control, asset and people tracking, and many more. Gyanendra and Pawan proposed a security system using a passive type of RFID contains a door locking system using an actuator. This project provides a cost-effective, flexible, and scalable solution for secure access control. It can be further enhanced with additional features such as remote monitoring, logging of access attempts, and time-based access restrictions, making it suitable for various applications in residential, commercial, or institutional environments.

III. LITERATURE SURVEY

1. Electronic door lock using RFID and password based on Arduino
In this system, the electronic door lock using RFID and password based on Arduino UNO. It uses in doors and cupboards as electronic lock and so on. The security system is important at homes, schools, offices and industries in real life. The purpose of this paper is to develop a smart home security system using RFID and keypad. RFID is ID card reader to read ID card’s value and Arduino UNO. If ID card reader is true, Arduino permits to press password on keypad. If password is true, lock style solenoid is unlock. If password is false, solenoid is lock. The electronic door lock system for home automation is able to interact with security management system for users and smart cards. Smart card is easy to use and accept more secure in real life. And then password is traditional but that is more impressive and more secure for human life. The Arduino microcontroller is used to control the whole system.
2. RFID and Finger Print Based Dual Security System: A robust
secured control to access through door lock operation RFID reader and fingerprint sensing device work as a locker of the security and RFID tag and a validly ratified finger is considered as the key of the locker. In case of access granted entity, door bar gets opened with a servo mechanism system connected with door bar. On the contrary, no action is taken as cavalcade if the entity is considered invalid in the sensing system. These knock out the necessity for keeping track of keys or remembering a combination of password or pin. A prototype of the security system is also designed and the performance of it is tested. The satisfactory results of its performance show the validity of the system and indicate a better solution for the future security system.
3. The automatic door lock to enhance security in RFID system Providing the security system for a room is a crucial in terms of protecting the valuable things and preventing the unauthorized access. Therefore, the security must be enhanced in order to keep off losing goods or important data [1]. In order to improve the security and authentication, an electronic locking system is designed. The implementation of this research is limited to the automation of door lock security system. The prototype device of door lock security system in the classroom by using RFID card would be forwarded to the control circuit by Arduino mega as the microcontroller then activated the magnetic solenoid to open the door. Only user which has been registered could access the classroom. Otherwise, the new user which has not been registered yet in database was not given right to enter the room. Based on the research and implementation of the device, showed that the device can run efficiently and effectively. This system helps the lectures improve the authentication approach to enhance the security, comfortability and privacy requirement.
4. Performance Analysis of RFID-Based Smart Door Lock Controlled by Arduino
Traditional door lock systems that usually use mechanical locks are now starting to be replaced with electrical and control-based lock systems that have more capabilities than traditional door lock systems. These techniques are an integration of mechanical devices, electronics, and intelligent control devices. One of the important features of this innovative lock system is its simplicity and high efficiency. In this research, an automatic lock system was constructed by combining mechanical and electrical components into a device. A microcontroller Arduino was used to control the whole functions of the system. The input component for this system is an RFID card or RFID Tag. An RFID reader is installed on the device to detect the RFID card used when accessing the door whether a registered card or not. A solenoid door lock is used as an output that will function as a door lock mechanism. The door lock system developed in this study is integrated with the attendance system database. The result of this research shows that the system can recognize the identity of the door accessor and is also able to store data in form of identity and time the door is accessed. The solenoid door lock will retract to unlock the door if the door is accessed with a registered RFID card and vice versa solenoid door lock will continue in the push position to lock the door if the door is accessed with a not registered RFID card. Some of the main performances of this system are that RFID read range from 0 - 20mm, RFID sensor can detect the presence of an RFID card even if it is blocked by objects such as papers, plastics, glass, and cloths. When objects such as aluminum or iron are present in between the RFID sensor and the RFID card, it will interfere with the signal so that the RFID sensor cannot detect the presence of the RFID Arduino.
5. Fingerprint Based Door Access System using Arduino From earlier times, security was and also till now is an issue of concern in our households and also in office, shops, etc. Everyone has a fear of unauthorized person entering to their home or office without their knowledge. The normal door can be fitted with locks which are capable of breaking with the use of an alternate key. Alternatives to this system can be found like the password or pattern system in the locks which again has the possibility of getting exposed and opening the lock. So, a solution to such problems can be by combining door lock with biometrics. Biometric verification is any means by which a person can be uniquely identified by evaluating one or more distinguishing biological traits. Unique identifiers include fingerprints, hand geometry, earlobe geometry, retina and iris patterns, voice waves, DNA, and signatures. Here we will use fingerprint for biometric verification as it is one such thing which is unique to every individual and the use of fingerprint as the key to door locks can overcome the security problem of unauthorized people trespassing to our homes, shops, offices, etc to a great extent as duplicacy in such key is not possible. Also, this system will not lead to problems like losing keys because we do not require carrying keys if this system is used instead of traditional locks. So, using Arduino we will try to implement the system with features which will increase the security level.

IV. METHODOLOGY

Step1: Identify the functional and security needs, including dual-factor authentication (RFID + PIN), control of a locking mechanism, and optional features like alarms for unauthorized access.
Step2: Connect the RFID reader to the Arduino’s SPI pins (SDA, SCK, MOSI, MISO, RST, and GND). Interface the keypad with Arduino using digital pins, which will capture user input.
Step3: Use an RFID library (such as the MFRC522 library) to read and process RFID tags. Store the authorized RFID tag IDs in the code Implement keypad input handling to capture the PIN entered by the user. Use the keypad library for easier interaction.
Step4: Test the individual components (RFID, keypad, lock, and feedback mechanisms) to ensure they work as expected. Test the full system by scanning RFID tags and entering PINs, ensuring the system correctly identifies authorized users and denies unauthorized access.
Step5: Add a feature to log access attempts, including time, RFID, and PIN data, for monitoring purposes. Enable Wi-Fi or Bluetooth modules for remote control via a smartphone app or web interface.
Step6: Design a suitable enclosure to house the Arduino and components, ensuring durability and ease of use. Mount the RFID reader keypad, and lock mechanism on the door.
Step7: Install the system in a real-world setting and test its performance over time to ensure reliability and robustness. Adjust parameters like lock activation time, feedback duration, and system responsiveness based on user needs.

VIII. CONCLUSION

The implementation of an RFID and keypad-based door lock system using Arduino offers a practical, secure, and cost-effective solution for access control in residential, commercial, and institutional settings. By combining RFID technology with a numeric keypad, the system provides dual-factor authentication, enhancing security by requiring both an authorized RFID tag and a correct PIN for access. The use of the Arduino UNO as the central microcontroller simplifies the integration of components like the RFID reader, keypad, and locking mechanism, making the system highly customizable and scalable. Electronic lock systems are preferable over mechanical locks, to resolve the security problems that are associated with the mechanical locks.
